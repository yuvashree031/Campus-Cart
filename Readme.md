# Campus-Cart

A web application developed to streamline food ordering for students by enabling online menu browsing, order placement, and secure payments. The system reduces long queues and waiting times, improving overall efficiency in campus cafeterias.

We built the frontend using HTML and CSS to provide a clean, responsive user interface, while the backend is developed in PHP with MySQL database integration for real-time order processing and data management. Students/Faculties can place and manage orders instantly, and administrators can track, update, and manage menu availability through an integrated admin dashboard.
